## What is STL?
The Standard Template Library (STL) is a collection of pre-written C++ classes and functions that provide common data structures and algorithms. It's essential for competitive programming as it saves implementation time, reduces bugs, and provides optimized implementations.

## STL Components
1. Containers - Data structures to store data
2. Algorithms - Functions to manipulate data
3. Iterators - Objects to traverse containers
4. Functors - Function objects for customization
